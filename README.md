## Machine Learning in Drug Discovery Resources 2024

### Datasets

[OpenADMET](https://openadmet.org)  
The OpenADMET project seeks to proactively characterize the chemical space accessible to
ADMET-associated proteins (“anti-targets”). By applying recent advances in experimental and computational techniques, a
comprehensive open library of experimental and structural datasets will be generated.

[AIRCHECK](https://aircheck.ai)  
AIRCHECK is a platform that provides access to a large collection of high-quality datasets for drug discovery and
development. The datasets are curated from various sources and are available in a standardized format. The current
focus appears to be on DNA encoded library (DEL) data.

[Polaris](https://polarishub.io)  
Polaris aims is to improve the state of benchmarking so ML can have a greater impact on real-world drug discovery
scenarios. To start, Polaris hopes to provide a single source of truth that aggregates and provides simple access to
datasets & benchmarks.

[PLINDER](https://plinder.sh)  
PLINDER is an academic-industry collaboration to address this, driven by VantAI, NVIDIA, the Computational Structural
Biology group at the University of Basel & SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics - co-organizers of CASP, and MIT.
PLINDER aims to provide a gold standard dataset and evaluations to push the field of computational protein-ligand
interactions
prediction forward.

### Blogs

[Charlie’s Substack](https://harrisbio.substack.com/)  
Charlie Harris writes about applications of AI in drug discovery.
Most recently, his posts have focused on efforts to reproduce AlphaFold3.

[Practical Cheminformatics](https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/)  
This is a blog where I post once a month
or so. These posts typically contain code that demonstrates various aspects of cheminformatics; clustering, machine
learning, data visualization, etc. I occasionally throw in posts containing opinions on things like AI and getting a
job.

[Is Life Worth Living](https://iwatobipen.wordpress.com/)  
A great blog from Iwatobipen (aka pen), whose posts are
chock full of great code examples. Pen always seems to be up on the latest methods and posts interesting examples on a
variety of topics ranging from quantum chemistry to machine learning.

[The RDKit Blog](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/)  
Greg Landrum is the primary contributor to, and BDFL, of the RDKit. In
addition to the latest and greatest features in the RDKit, Greg's posts also touch on a number of key issues in
Cheminformatics, such as dealing with unbalanced datasets and the impact of fingerprint folding on similarity searching.
